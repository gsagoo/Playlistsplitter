# Playlistsplitter
Perl script that splits a music pls file (Linux format) into artist and songtitles text files.

You may run the script with the following command 
  '''
  perl playlistsplitter.pl defaultmusicplaylist.pls
  '''
 
There are many improvements needed for this code, it was merely written for the illustration of 
reading a file, writing a file and pattern matching using perl regex.
